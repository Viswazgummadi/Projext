# README

This repository contains the implementation of a project focused on image processing and computer vision techniques. Below is an overview of the contents and how to navigate through them:

## Folder Structure

- **part_1**: This folder contains the Jupyter Notebook `bot.ipynb`, where you can find the code related to the initial stages of the project.

- **part_2**: This folder contains the continuation of the project. It includes various modules and notebooks for different tasks:

    - `clustering.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a color clustering algorithm using KMeans.
    
    - `border_detection.ipynb`: This notebook showcases the process of detecting borders and edges in images using techniques like Canny edge detection.
    
    - `classifier.ipynb`: This notebook illustrates the development of a classifier using machine learning algorithms to categorize images based on certain features.
    
    - `web_app`: This directory contains the files for a web application built to interact with the image processing functionalities developed in the project.

## How to Use

1. **Initial Setup**: Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Navigate to Part 2**: Go to the `part_2` directory to explore the advanced functionalities of the project.

    ```bash
    cd part_2
    ```

3. **Explore Notebooks**: Open the Jupyter Notebooks (`clustering.ipynb`, `border_detection.ipynb`, `classifier.ipynb`) to delve into the different image processing techniques implemented in the project.

4. **Run Web Application**: Navigate to the `web_app` directory and follow the instructions in the README file to run the web application.
